# chiblog:remake - [WIP]the next generation of chiblog

The mess of the previous chiblog application has become so overwhelming that it's hard to make sense of anything anymore. So, it's time to clean up and start building another mountain of chaosâ€”but hopefully a more organized one this time!

# why chiblog:remake?

The chiblog:remake introduces several exciting new features. It includes a completely revamped backend service written in Golang, capable of managing a Nuxt-based frontend application as a daemon while handling backend data storage efficiently. Additionally, the frontend theme will offer smoother animations and enhanced visual elements for a more polished and seamless user experience.

# development schedule

The legacy version of chiblog has been deprecated and ceased receiving updates since August 2024. Once the development of chiblog:remake is complete, the legacy version will be archived. Its container service will also be updated to notify users to migrate their legacy chiblog applications to the new chiblog:remake.

The development process for chiblog:remake is scheduled to be completed by July 2025.
